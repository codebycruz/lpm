# Using LÖVE

Love2d requires dependencies slightly differently than traditional lua by default, which makes it harder to integrate with projects like luarocks. But it is quite easy to use with lpm!

## Using LPM from a LÖVE project

Simply add this to your `main.lua`

```lua
package.path = package.path .. ";./target/?.lua;./target/?/init.lua"
```

This will make it so love2d resolves modules from the `./target` directory, which is where LPM installs dependencies to. Happy hacking!

## Using LÖVE in an LPM project

Since love2d has its entrypoint as `main.lua`, you can do the same as the above, except afterwards, require your own entrypoint as a module, like so:

```lua
package.path = package.path .. ";./target/?.lua;./target/?/init.lua"
require("yourproject")
```

This will set up your require paths and call into your `./src/init.lua`, so you can write as if you're just writing a normal lpm project, while using love2d!

## Types

Unfortunately at the moment, there's no clean solution to this offered by lpm. You might get a decent solution with LuaLS' library support.

Ideally in the future love2d could offer an lpm compatible package purely for types, but it should also be on us to do so.
