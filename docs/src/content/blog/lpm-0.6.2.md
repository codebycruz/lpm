## `bin` field in `lpm.json`

You can now set a `bin` field in your `lpm.json` to declare the entrypoint used by `lpm run` and `lpm x`. This is useful for packages that expose both a library and a CLI entrypoint as separate files.

```json
{
	"name": "my-tool",
	"bin": "cli.lua"
}
```

## `lpm bundle --bytecode`

`lpm bundle --bytecode` now compiles the entire output file to LuaJIT bytecode, producing a bytecode blob instead of a Lua source file. This reduces file size and improves startup time.

Previously, it only stored each individual file that was dynamically loaded as bytecode.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed `lpm run` with an external engine (e.g. `"engine": "lua"` in `lpm.json`) not inheriting stdout/stderr — output was silently swallowed instead of being shown to the user.
- Fixed `lpm run` with the `lpm` engine not setting the working directory to the project's directory when running build scripts.
- Fixed `lpm x` running tools with the working directory set to the package location instead of where the user invoked the command.
