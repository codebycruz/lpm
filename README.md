`lpm` is a package manager for Lua, written in Lua.

It was created due to my frustration with the current status quo of package management in the Lua ecosystem.

- [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org) is sorely dated, difficult to manage, and hardly maintained.
- [Lux](https://github.com/lumen-oss/lux), while promising, is written in Rust and seems to be targeting backwards compatibility with LuaRocks.

A more in-depth comparison can be found below.

## Features

- Easy project creation with `lpm new` and `lpm init`
- Automatic local package management, avoid conflicting global installs
- `lpm add --path <package>` - Install local dependencies (good for monorepos)
- `lpm add --git <repo>` - Install git dependencies (supports monorepos)
- `lpm run` - Runs your project's init file and installs dependencies
- `lpm compile` - Turn your project into a single executable, easily distributable
- `lpm test` - Run project tests with the built-in test framework, [`lpm-test`](./packages/lpm-test)
- `lpm bundle` - Bundle your project into a single lua file
- `lpm x` - Execute a project in another location, perfect for CLIs
- `lpm tree` - View your dependencies at a glance

## Installation

_To upgrade your `lpm` version, simply run `lpm upgrade`!_

## Quickstart

Create a project with dependencies..

```bash
lpm new myproject && cd myproject
lpm add hood --git https://github.com/codebycruz/hood
echo "print(require('hood'))" > ./src/init.lua
lpm run
# Output: table: 0x7f53326fd030
```

Or run a repository's code in a single command!

```bash
lpm x triangle --git https://github.com/codebycruz/hood
```
